TODO
====
  * Purge old / inactive games
  * List of currently loggend-in users
  * sometimes Disks can be dropped Even if Game is closed
  * Allow 'Pass turn' while game is 'new'
  * Disk should flash a bit after they were dropped
  * There should be a 'Player 1 has won' message
  * List all users with # of games and wins, sorted by wins.
  * Undo last move (more difficult with 'Pop Out' rule)
  * Implement 'Pop Out' rule variation (i.e. users can remove own disks from the bottom row): <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four#Pop_Out>
  * Security (who can reset games?)
